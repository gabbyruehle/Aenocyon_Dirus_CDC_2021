# Submissions

Submissions will be done through Devpost this year. Please make an account and register as a hackathon participant if you haven't done so already ([Link](https://cdcunc21.devpost.com/)).

## Submission Requirements

In order to be qualified for a reward, you must submit both of the following:
1. 5 minute Presentation Video
2. Github repository link
Any teams that don't submit either of the 2, will not be in consideration for a prize.

### Presentation Video
This video is to be **at most** 5 minutes long (it can be shorter if desired). It can be submitted as a YouTube link (public/unlisted) or on any other streaming platform as long as the video is be publicly accessible through the link.

### Github Repository Link
We require the Github repository within which you completed your project. The link supplied must be public for the very least the duration of submission, judging, and until the end of the closing ceremony.

Devpost itself has a few other submission requirements in order to finish your submission. Please fill those out to the best of your abilities. It will help us and the judges get a better understanding of your project.

## Tracks
This year we have 4 tracks: Healthcare, Finance, Social Science, and Media. Remember that you may only enter into one track and that track must one of those that you used a corresponding dataset of.

## Teams
On the topic of teams. Teams are to be finalized during the Devpost submission process. Only one person needs to submit, but they will need to add the Devpost profiles of the remaining members during submission. Please remember we have a policy of a maximum of 4 people per team.
